Path of Steel is a 3D isometric roguelike, inspired by games like Hades and Diablo, and just a hint of the movie Terminator.

Play as Jisa, and attune your body to the primal essences of her planet in order to confront the cyborg threat. 
Choose your own path by specializing in different essences, and take advantage of their respective tiles to decimate your foes.

The essence of Velheret, associated with the green tile, will provide Jisa with a self-recharging shield, and modify her skills to have healing and HP-altering effects.
The essence of Ilsihre, associated with the red tile, will burn Jisa, effectively dealing damage to her, but will also allow her to burn her enemies in return. When attuned to this essence, her skills deal incredible amounts of damage, and scale further with her lost health.
The essence of Shalharan, associated with the white tile, will hasten Jisa, and modify her skills to reset her roll cooldowns and manipulate the movement of her enemies.
